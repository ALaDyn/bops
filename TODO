7/1/05	Trapezoidal profile (inprof=4): trailing edge should match
	L/lambda on front side
=========
3/6/05  Simpler means for setting up exponential profile (inprof=5),
	with error trapping for invalid/nonsensical inputs
=========
General:

- Postprocessor for '2D' plots - perhaps with GMT?

- Fully fluid transverse momenta: exploit p=eA in boost frame 

- Use 1D charge-conserving wave propag. scheme of Villasenor & Buneman
  to replace Poisson's equation for relativistic HHG 
  and avoid inconsistency with time-retardation effects (see paper by
  Playa)
